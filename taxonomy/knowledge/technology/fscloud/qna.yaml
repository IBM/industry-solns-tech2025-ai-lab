  - context: |
      IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services is designed to help address the
      needs of financial services institutions with regulatory compliance,
      security, and resiliency during the initial deployment phase and with
      ongoing operations. The framework also helps to simplify the ability of
      financial institutions to transact with ecosystem partners who deliver
      software or SaaS applications, and who meet the requirements of the
      framework.
      The IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services consists of:
      * A comprehensive set of control requirements designed to help address the
      security requirements and regulatory compliance obligations of financial
      institutions and cloud best practices. The cloud best practices include a
      shared responsibility model across financial institutions, application
      providers, and IBM Cloud.
      * Detailed control-by-control guidance for implementation and supporting
      evidence to help address the security and regulatory requirements of the
      financial industry.
      * Reference architectures designed to facilitate compliance with the
      control requirements. In addition, resources are provided to deploy
      infrastructure as code in order to automate deployment and configuration
      of the reference architectures.
      * Tools and IBM services, such as IBM CloudÂ® Security and Compliance
      Center, to enable parties to efficiently and effectively monitor
      compliance, remediate issues, and generate evidence of compliance.
      * Ongoing governance of the framework documentation that considers new and
      changing regulations, as well as bank and public cloud requirements.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the different aspects which form the IBM Cloud framework for
          Financial Services?
        answer: |
          The framework includes a set of security and compliance control
          requirements of financial industry, guidance in terms of documentation
          and automation for implementing and gathering evidence to address
          those requirements, reference architectures and automation to setup
          complex solution environments as well as tols and services such as IBM
          SCC to continously monitor and report on security and compliance
          posture.
      - question: |
          What are the automation tools available to create environments based
          on the reference architecture?
        answer: |
          The IBM Deployable Architectures or DA for short are Infrastructure as
          Code resources and associated configuration which allow to
          consistently and rapidly deploy environments conforming to the
          reference architecture. They leverage terraform modules and ansible
          scripts for automation.
      - question: |
          How does the framework handle the evolving regulatory framework.
        answer: |
          The governance of the framework continously considers new and changing
          regulations and is enriched with input from all stakeholders in the
          ecosystem.
  - context: |
      The technology-agnostic control requirements defined in the framework were
      built by the industry for the industry. The framework contains 565 control
      requirements that span 7 focus areas and 21 control families. The control
      requirements were initially based on NIST 800-53 Rev 4 and have been
      enhanced based on feedback from leading industry partners.
      See IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services - Control Requirements for
      a complete description of all control requirements.
      You should use the information in the framework if you are an application
      provider (whether from a financial institution or ecosystem partner) who
      wishes to meet the requirements or leverage the best practices of IBM
      Cloud for Financial Services. However, the content has a different purpose
      depending on whether you represent an application provider from an
      ecosystem partner or an application provider within a financial
      institution.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a consumer and what is an application provider?
        answer: |
          We refer to the entity that uses (consumes) the application as the
          consumer and the entity that deploys (provides) the application as the
          application provider. The application provider and consumer might be
          the same when the organization providing the application also consumes
          it (for example, a financial institution deploys an application for
          internal use by others in their company). Or, they can be different
          when a third-party ISV provides an application for a financial
          institution to use. Application providers who are within financial
          institutions are not beholden to the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial
          Services control requirements.
      - question: |
          What are the control requirements defined in IBM Cloud for Financial
          Services based on?
        answer: |
          The control requirements were initially based on NIST 800-53 Rev 4 and
          have been enhanced based on feedback from leading industry partners.
      - question: |
           What are the 7 focus areas that the control requirements are
           categorized into?
        answer: |
          The 7 focus areas which encompass the 21 control families are 1.
          Focussed Risk Management and Compliance, 2. Advanced Data Protection,
          3. Enhanced Authentication and Access Management, 4.  Automated
          Workload and Application Protection, 5. Unified Infrastructure and
          Security Resiliency, 6. Operational Excellence, 7. Active Monitoring
          and Response.
  - context: |
      The reference architectures and associated guidance are intended to help
      you meet the Financial Services Validation process performs assurance
      activities to enable confidence in the implementation of the controls.
      The overall security categorization of the data will guide the
      functionality and assurance required from a cloud service being used to
      protect the data. For example, while Hyper Protect Crypto Services and Key
      Protect have received the same level of assurance, both being Financial
      Services Validated, they each provide different security functionality.
      They may be used to protect data with a different security categorization.
      For a further discussion on the differences, read Data encryption at rest
      in IBM Cloud for a comparison of functionality.  When it comes to
      differences in assurance, there are multiple options for audit logging.
      You can use Activity Tracker Event Routing, that's Financial Services
      Validated, to forward logs to either IBM Cloud Object Storage or Event
      Streams (Enterprise Plan) and then use a custom solution for an audit
      event monitoring application. An alternative is to use Activity Tracker
      hosted event search, that's not Financial Services Validated, but has
      audit event monitoring built-in. The overall security categorization of
      the data should guide whether you need the assurance provided with a
      Financial Services Validated solution.

      When you think about modifying a security solution because of a lower
      security categorization, think about the two dimensions of functionality
      and assurance.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Are the reference architectures comprehensive and useable as-is in all
          cases?
        answer: |
          The reference architectures and associated guidance are intended to
          help you meet the control requirements in the IBM Cloud Framework for
          Financial Services. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach
          for designing solutions for regulated industries, and you have
          latitude to make adjustments based on your situation. Ultimately, you
          are responsible for your choices based on careful consideration of
          organizational policies, data classification requirements,
          vulnerability and threat information, applicable regulations,
          compliance standards, and risk appetite.
      - question: |
          What can help you decide what controls need to be met by an
          application?
        answer: |
          One approach to help you make decisions is to do a security
          categorization of your workloads and data. The Standards for Security
          Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems (FIPS
          199) provides a framework for security categorization of information
          and information systems. The security categories it defines are based
          on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur
          which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the
          organization to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets,
          fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions,
          and protect individuals.
      - question: What is functionality and assurance?
        answer: |
          Traditionally, security has been divided into two perspectives -
          functionality and assurance. Functionality is the security
          capabilities described by a policy, control framework, or security
          target. Assurance is a set of activities that give confidence in the
          implementation and operation of control requirements. The type of
          assurance can vary depending on the scope of the control framework and
          the amount of effort put into confirming the implementation and
          operation of the control requirements. In this case, the Financial
          Services Validation process performs assurance activities to enable
          confidence in the implementation of the controls.
