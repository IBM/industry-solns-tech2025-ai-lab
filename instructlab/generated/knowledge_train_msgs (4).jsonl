With built-in security and controls informed by the industry, IBM Cloud for Financial Services can help you optimize your infrastructure and demonstrate compliance so you can focus on what matters most: delivering value for your clients.\n\nIBM Cloud for Financial Services is designed to build trust and enable a transparent public cloud ecosystem with the features for security, compliance, and resiliency that financial institutions require. Financial institutions can confidently host their mission-critical applications in the cloud and transact quickly and efficiently.\n\nWith a large partner ecosystem of independent software vendors (ISVs), Software as a Service (SaaS), and fintech partners, IBM Cloud for Financial Services offers a new generation of cloud for the enterprise. Financial institutions can now deploy on public cloud to enable innovation and deliver new outstanding customer experiences, while managing stringent industry regulations for sensitive data and complex workloads.\n\n# **IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services**\n\nIBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services is designed to help address the needs of financial services institutions with regulatory compliance, security, and resiliency during the initial deployment phase and with ongoing operations. The framework also helps to simplify the ability of financial institutions to transact with ecosystem partners who deliver software or SaaS applications, and who meet the requirements of the framework.\n\nThe IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services consists of:\n\n- A comprehensive set of control requirements designed to help address the security requirements and regulatory compliance obligations of financial institutions and cloud best practices. The cloud best practices include a shared responsibility model across financial institutions, application providers, and IBM Cloud.\n\n- Detailed control-by-control guidance for implementation and supporting evidence to help address the security and regulatory requirements of the financial industry.\n\n- Reference architectures designed to facilitate compliance with the control requirements.
