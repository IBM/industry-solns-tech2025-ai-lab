# Lab Part B Concepts

In this lab, we will explore how a chatbot interacts with a machine learning model served on a RHEL AI VSI (Virtual Server Instance). The chatbot can summarize documents and answer domain-specific questions. 

We will also investigate the impact of fine-tuning a model on and specialized knowledge, such as IBM Cloud for Financial Services. 

## Lab Concepts Dictionary

### Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook)

A web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used for data science, scientific computing, and education.

### Function (Python programming)

A block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword and can take arguments and return values.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. LLMs are capable of understanding and responding to natural language inputs.

### InstructLab

 InstructLab is an open-source project designed to facilitate contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing developers to create, fine-tune, and experiment with AI models. It sets the groundwork for scalable AI by enabling collaborative development and model enhancement.

### RHEL AI

Built on top of InstructLab, RHEL AI brings these models to a production-ready environment for individual developers and small teams. RHEL AI simplifies deployment with a single-server setup and integrates InstructLab, creating an efficient platform for testing and deploying generative AI models in real-world use cases without requiring high availability.

### Virtual Server Instance (VSI)

A virtual machine in the cloud, providing scalable computing resources for running applications.

### Base Model

A pre-trained model designed for general tasks, often requiring further training for specialized use. 

### Fine-tuned Model

A base model that has been further trained on domain-specific data to improve performance in specialized tasks.
