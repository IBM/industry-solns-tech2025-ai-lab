# Lab Part A Concepts

We will explore the concept of Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), where an AI agent interacts with users and other systems to perform tasks. An agentic AI system consists of autonomous agents that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions based on predetermined goals.

LangGraph is an open-source graph-based framework for building agentic AI systems. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define the structure of an AI agent's behavior. LangGraph allows developers to create sophisticated AI agents that can reason about complex tasks, make decisions based on incomplete information, and adapt to changing circumstances.

## Lab Concepts Dictionary

### Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook)

A web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used for data science, scientific computing, and education.

### Function (Python programming)

A block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword and can take arguments and return values.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. LLMs are capable of understanding and responding to natural language inputs.

### Agentic AI

A type of artificial intelligence (AI) that possesses a sense of agency, meaning it can take actions independently based on its goals and intentions. Agentic AI models aim to replicate human-like decision-making and problem-solving abilities.

### Agent (Agentic AI topic)

An autonomous agent is an advanced form of AI that can understand and respond to inquiries, then take action without human intervention. When they’re given an objective, they can generate tasks for themselves, complete assigned tasks, and work on the next one, until the objective is complete.

### Tools (Agentic AI topic)

Software or hardware components used to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of agentic AI models. Examples include programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and data management systems.

### LangGraph (Agentic AI topic)

LangGraph is an open-source framework that helps developers build, manage, and deploy AI agent workflows. LangGraph helps these AI agents coordinate their actions and remember past information, so the entire process flows smoothly.

### Framework (LangGraph and Agentic AI topic)

An agentic framework (or agent framework) is a set of tools or a structure designed to help you build and manage autonomous agents—AI systems that can act on their own to achieve specific goals or tasks.

These frameworks make it easier to create and control AI agents that can make decisions, take actions, and learn over time—without needing constant human guidance.

### Agentic AI vs Generative AI

Generative AI focuses on creating new content like text, images, or music, while agentic AI prioritizes autonomous decision-making and taking actions to achieve specific goals, essentially acting independently within an environment rather than just generating content.
