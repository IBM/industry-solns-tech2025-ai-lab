# Notebook Walkthrough Exercise 1

In this section, you will explore the existing capabilities of the AI agent designed to assist in assessing loan risks. To get started, you will run the provided Python notebook, which will allow you to familiarize yourself with the available tools.

Each cell in the notebook needs to be executed in sequence. Below, you will find explanations for what each cell does, as well as context on how it fits into the overall process. Action will be required in some cases and will be clearly indicated. In other instances, you can simply observe the output generated by the cell and proceed to the next one.

-----

**Cell 1: Set up required libraries**

**No action required**.

**Explanation**: <br>

This cell imports the necessary libraries that the notebook will use. These libraries, such as `langgraph` and `langchain`, help in managing the AI agent’s logic, integrating tools, and processing data. Observe that these libraries are initialized and available for use throughout the rest of the notebook.

-----

**Cell 2: Define functions to get and check credentials**

**Action required**: Paste in the API key when prompted.

**Explanation**: <br>

This cell sets up the necessary credentials. You will need to paste their API key that you copied earlier.

-----

**Cell 3: Define tools that the AI agent can use**

**No action required**.  

**Explanation**: <br>

This cell defines the tools that the AI agent will use to gather information. Specifically:
- `get_customer_info()`: A mock API call that simulates retrieving customer data such as credit scores and account status.
- `get_credit_score()` and `get_account_status()`: tools that retrieve specific pieces of customer information using the `get_customer_info()` tool.
- `get_overall_risk()`: This tool assesses the customer's overall loan risk by combining the credit score and account status, based on predefined risk rules.

The AI agent uses these tools to respond to questions.

-----

**Cell 4: Configure the LLM (mistralai/mistral-large)**

**No action required**.

**Explanation**: <br>

This cell configures the large language model (LLM) that powers the AI agent. The chosen model is `mistral-large`, which will process natural language input (such as questions) and produce responses.

-----

**Cell 5: Define the LangGraph graph and functions for state and runtime processing**

**No action required**.  

**Explanation**: <br>

 In this cell, LangGraph is used to create the flow and structure for the AI agent. LangGraph manages the state and runtime of the system, ensuring the AI can properly sequence tool usage and respond to queries.

-----

**Cell 6: Show a visual representation of the graph - the AI agent with tools**

**No action required**.  

**Explanation**: <br>

This cell provides a visual representation of the AI agent, showing how it interacts with the various tools defined earlier.

-----

**Cell 7: Use the AI agent - ask the AI agent a risk-related question**

**Action required**: Interact with the AI agent by posing a question when prompted. Find example questions in the notebook.

**Explanation**: <br>

 In this cell, you will test the AI’s functionality by asking natural language questions. The AI will process the question, determine the necessary tools to use, and provide a response based on the customer’s data. 

-----

**Cell 8: Review the response from the AI agent**

**No action required**.  

**Explanation**: <br> 

In this cell, reviews the response from the AI agent to the question asked in the previous step. The response will be based on the data and risk rules implemented in the tools. Observe the accuracy and relevance of the response, confirming that the system correctly interpreted the query and used the appropriate tools to generate an answer.


Note: You can rerun cells 7 and 8 again and ask other questions.
