# Lab Part B Overview

**Introduction**

In this lab, you will work with a simple chatbot to interact with a model served on a RHEL AI VSI and summarize external assets. Then you will explore the functionality of a chatbot and understand the difference between a base model and a fine-tuned model.

**Learning Outcomes**

- You will interact with a model hosted on a remote server.

- You will practice loading external data into the chatbot and using it to form prompts for summarization.

- You will identify and explore the limitations of the base Mistral-7b model in handling certain topics, such as IBM Cloud for Financial Services.

- You will interact with a fine-tuned model that has been trained on synthetic generated data and learn how to take advantage of its enhanced capabilities.

**Your Task**

- **Exercise 1.a** <br> 
Chat with a Mistral-7b model served on a RHEL AI VSI instance.

- **Exercise 1.b** <br> 
Summarize documents using external assets.

- **Exercise 2** <br>
Ask about IBM Cloud for Financial Services to expose limitations of the base model.

- **Exercise 3** <br>
Chat with a fine-tuned model that has been trained on synthetic generated data (SGD) and learn how to take advantage of its enhanced capabilities. Ask about IBM Cloud for Financial Services.
